# Workspace Boundary (RayViewsLab)

Canonical workspace (single source of truth):

- `/Users/ray/Documents/openclaw`

## Rule (hard)

- All RayViewsLab work must be implemented in `/Users/ray/Documents/openclaw`.
- Do not develop in `/Users/ray/Documents/New project` or `/Users/ray/Documents/Rayviews`.
- If another folder is opened, stop and switch to `/Users/ray/Documents/openclaw`.

## Collaboration rule

- Before edits, state canonical repo path explicitly.
- Before push, confirm branch + remote from this repo only.

hey honestly I love your videos but I
don't have time to watch a 2hour long
chair review just tell me what is the
best chair I totally get it I think the
best chair is the Herman Miller gaming
EMB body this thing is fantastic it
feels like no other chair on the market
and it's expensive coming in at just
under 2,000 bucks but it comes with a
12-year warranty and excellent customer
service you can also get an aftermarket
headrest I think this is the best
headrest ever built but again pricey it
comes in at just under 200 bucks what
the I must be distracted by your
new beautiful hair dude because did you
just say
$2,000 okay um I struggle with lower
back pain will the gaming body help with
that it's definitely possible but I
think the best chair for lower back pain
and better posture is going to be the
anthos chair these cushions on this
chair on the back and the seat are
ridiculously soft yet supportive these
guys have experience building
wheelchairs so they know what it's like
to have to sit all day long but where it
really shines is going to be in the
pelvic support that you can really dial
in and also the back rest support which
you can di depending on whether you want
to sit upright or a little bit more back
throughout the day excellent customer
service 12year warranty free returns it
cost $1,800 if you use my coupon code
down below okay I don't want to spend
that much on a chair do you have
anything cheaper I get it so that's why
I brought out the kamami atlas this is a
$260 chair but it has features and
adjustments that you only see on chairs
that are much much higher priced also
this thing has a fat seat cushion which
means you know it's not going to
compress quickly over time time for a
chair under 300 bucks this is one of the
best but does the kamami atlas come with
that warranty and stuff that you were
talking about earlier if you want a
chair that's backed by an excellent
customer service 12year warranty and
free returns the Hayward soji is
definitely going to be the pick people
of all Heights praise this chair and
some people even say it's hayward's best
chair because of its price point it's an
excellent chair and it comes in just
under 600 bucks if you want a chair
that's got better build quality and it
flexes with you throughout the day the
steel case am Mia at around 1,000 bucks
is my favorite Steelcase chair this
thing is also backed by a 12year
warranty excellent customer service and
free returns as well but Dan I get
really really hot
like got any recommendations for me as
of right now my favorite mesh chair
under $200 is the Staples dexley the
sitting experience in this chair feels
really good it's got a massive headrest
as well adjustable lumbar support and
it's backed by a 7-year warranty and
from what I could read online here in
the United States staples's customer
service is pretty good but what if I'm
on the heavier side you know a little
more to love is the budget mesh on the
Dex Le going to Sag if you're over 150
lbs I always recommend people go with a
high-end mesh chair with solid warranty
and if you're looking for a mesh chair
that's built like a tank the tried and
true Herm Miller Aon is going to be your
choice I mean this thing is the most
famous chair in the world for a reason
just keep in mind that it's got hard
edges and the frame is stiff which means
that if you want like moving around
throughout the day or you're a Tucker
single leg Tucker double leg Tucker it's
not going to be great for you this chair
does come in three different sizes a
size a which is small B medium and C
large to really customize for your body
type if you want a headrest for it you
can get an aftermarket one from Atlas
headrest they make a fabric one here
that you see or they make a one toone
matching mesh it looks OEM coupon code
link will be down in the description
below but I'm an ergonomic rebel I like
to tuck my leg I like to move around
inside of the chair any mesh chairs for
me in that case I recommend the
Steelcase car it comes in a regular back
or a tall back if you're on the taller
side and these chairs are incredibly
flexible they Bend and move with you and
what's really unique about them is that
because of the flat seat you can
actually single or even double tuck
inside of these chairs which is
something that I haven't seen of any
other mes chair out there it's also
cheaper than the her Miller airon as
well honestly I really appreciate your
help and I'm definitely going to use
your links when I pick up my chair I'm
also going to like And subscribe and

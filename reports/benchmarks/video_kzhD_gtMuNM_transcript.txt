greetings YouTube performance reviews
where I give you the review from the
technician's point of view and today
we're going to be making a list of the
top five vacuums I think you should be
looking at that you may never have heard
of or even seen advertised now if you're
new to the channel I have years of
experience fixing and repairing machines
I'm even crazy enough to collect vacuum
cleaners now the criteria for this list
are the best of the best a vacuum
cleaner should last at least a decade it
should contain the dirt that it picks up
and not put it out should actually be
powerful enough to pick up dirt deep
down between cracks in the carpet so if
you're looking for another shill for one
of the big vacuum companies this is not
that video this is my honest opinion of
what are the top five vacuum cleaners
right now here in the United States now
if you're outside the United States you
have a different market and this list is
probably not going to apply to you other
thing that you want to look at before
you consider anything off this list is
what kind of flooring and how big is
your house obviously an apartment with
with all hard floor and one area rug is
going to need a very different vacuum
than a Big 5 000 square foot house with
all sorts of surfaces and wall-to-wall
carpet now with all that in mind this
list isn't actually in any particular
order so keep in mind some of these
vacuums are only going to apply to
certain types of flooring
first one on this list is made by the
German vacuum manufacturer sibo and if
you're not familiar with sibo you should
be they are one of the best
manufacturers of vacuum cleaners today
they make everything in Germany they
build their stuff to last in fact they
build them to last over 2 000 working
hours on top of that this machine is
versatile powerful and the original Lift
Away Vacuum Cleaner I'll put a link to
the dart in the description below but if
you want a Felix you are going to have
to go into your local dealer and pick
one up I'll have a link below to that as
well
number four is Henry particularly Henry
compact which here in the United States
is distributed by Nace care though the
brand is pneumatic so a Pneumatic
compact 160 is the model I'm
specifically recommending which is what
you want to pick if you're in the house
it balances nicely on the stairs the
machine again is made to last a tough
2000 plus working hours it uses standard
inch and a quarter accessories and comes
with a good set of this will work tools
now this is an option if you have hard
floors and area rugs this is not a
machine I would recommend if you have
Oodles of wall-to-wall carpet I will
have a link to this machine in the
description as well so that you can pick
one up you also might call around a lot
of times your local vacuum store will
carry this one as well
number three is made by the Italian
manufacturer Lind house now Lind house
makes all sorts of big commercial
equipment but they also make domestic
vacuums specifically the hf6 with an
electric power head is a steel and will
clean a very large house it has a long
cord a large capacity so if you have a
lot of pet hair and you can't put in a
central vacuum this is a good machine to
look at and it's also really reasonably
priced so go check out a lint house hf6
I'll put a link below to that as well I
would encourage you to check out your
local dealer if you have one in your
area
hey before we move on to number two if
you could please give this video a
thumbs up that helps this channel a
whole lot comment below on which one of
these was your favorite and if you
really like what we're doing go check
out our Twitter feed there'll be a link
below to that as well
coming in at number two is the
german-made Mila C3 series of vacuum
cleaners the Mila C3 originally was
known as the S8 so it's been around a
while it's been proven my time
it's a really excellent durable design
the machines capable of doing all sorts
of flooring though there are models that
are specific to only hard floor so
understand what you're buying but it
comes with the vessel work ebk 360
nozzle they call it an Seb 228 when I
brought this machine home for review I
was surprised at how much better it was
than when I saw it on the bench or in
the store it just kind of blew me away
it also is a very powerful machine one
of the most powerful canister vacuums on
the market today and on top of that it's
quiet and easy on the ears so if you're
looking for a do-all vacuum you can't go
wrong with the Miele C3 I even gave one
to my mother-in-law so that should say
something right there I'll put a link
below both your local dealer and to
where you can purchase them online
number one on the list is also from the
German manufacturer sibo and I'm not
being paved by sibo guys they have no
idea that I'm making this but it has
been a favorite vacuum of mine for a
long time which is the sibo E-Series now
the sibo E Series is comparable to the
Miele C3 in that it does have different
models for different flooring so you'll
see the E2 which is for hard floor and
area rugs and then there's the E3 which
is for carpet and hard floor and that's
probably the model you'll want to look
at the E3 is one of the most
maneuverable canister vacuums on the
market today it's also got one of the
best priced Expendables of any vacuum on
the market today now the E3 is also one
of the most powerful vacuums we've
tested in terms of its airflow working
vacuum and sealed suction so it's sure
to get the job done no matter what kind
of flooring you have however this is not
one I can link below this is one again
that you need to walk into a brick and
mortar store to purchase which you have
seen has been kind of a theme of this
video the better Brands don't just sell
them anywhere they want to sell them in
locations where people will service them
and show you how to use them and make
sure you're getting the right vacuum for
you so I'm going to encourage you to go
down to the description box check out
the Dr locators see what's close by for
you to purchase and you to go see and
test drive and you don't have to take my
word for any of these you can just call
up your local vacuum store and I'm sure
it'll have favorable things to say about
everything on this list if they sell
them now I do want to address something
somebody's going to ask me which is
which one do I have at home well that is
the most loaded question I review
vacuums and collect them so I have both
which vacuum do I use every day neither
I have a central vacuum and that's what
I prefer
but not everybody wants to put a central
vacuum or has the ability to put a
central vacuum in so if you have any
additional questions about these type
them in the comments below I will try to
answer them within the first couple of
days of this video and I will pin
anything that seems particularly useful
as well so definitely check that out uh
if you just love vacuum cleaners go
check out our Discord that's awesome and
big thank you to our patreon supporters

# Script Patterns — video_bYG2URoquF8

**Channel:** Elliot Page (sneaker/lifestyle reviewer)
**Title:** Top 10 Best Adidas Sneakers to Buy in 2026
**Views:** ~116K | **Length:** ~14:19
**Classification:** MID-TIER benchmark (natural tone, some structural repetition)

## Hook Style

Mild overwhelm + direct question:

- "2026 is looking like a pretty insane year for sneakers from Adidas."
- "They honestly have some of the best range when it comes to comfortable, affordable, and unique options."
- "But which ones are actually worth your money?"

Not the strongest hook — lacks specific jargon confusion or expert authority. But casual and honest.

## Product Intro Patterns

**Warning:** Heavy reliance on "Coming in at number [X]" — appears 7+ times. This is a structural weakness.

Variations used:

- "Coming in at number [X], the [product]." (most common — avoid)
- "Taking the number [X] spot, we got [product]." (slightly better)
- "But coming in at number [X], we've got [product]." (adds continuity)
- Direct statement: "It's the classics. Look, when Adidas finds something that works..." (#5 — best intro in the video)

**Takeaway:** The #5 entry (classics group) breaks the formula and is the most engaging intro. Proves that ditching the number callout works better.

## Opinion Markers (strength of this channel)

Very frequent, casual opinion delivery:

- "Honestly, it's an incredible everyday option"
- "I'm a big fan of these"
- "one of my personal favorite sneakers on the market, regardless of brand"
- "I love these things"
- "They look sick"
- "Those are bangers" (slang — authentic)
- "it's almost a no-brainer at that point"
- "I think they're going to have a huge year"

### Short punches:

- "They look sick."
- "Those are bangers."
- "Super cozy."
- "No idea why."
- "Highly recommend."

## Trust/Limitation Patterns

Limitations are present but inconsistent — not every product gets one:

- "It's in the early days of the rollout" (availability caveat)
- "They're a little bit on the heavier side" (physical limitation)
- "They're not the most comfortable shoes. They're not the best quality shoes." (#5 classics — strongest honest moment)
- "it's not going to be directly from Adidas. That's the only problem with this pair of shoes." (availability)
- "a gusseted tongue which is a little bit annoying from the original" (#1 — even the winner gets a knock)

**Takeaway:** The best limitation moments come when he's bluntly honest ("They're not the most comfortable shoes"). The hedged ones ("a little bit on the heavier side") are weaker.

## Structural Techniques

### Honorable Mentions quickfire round:

- "Before we get into the top three, you know what we got to do? A quick fire round."
- Three products covered in ~90 seconds — builds anticipation for top 3.

### Grouping related products:

- Grouped Samba, Superstar, Gazelle, SL72 into one #5 slot: "I'm going to cheat a little bit. Okay, just allow it."
- Smart technique for avoiding repetitive entries of similar products.

### Comparison anchors:

- "It reminds me a lot of the New Balance 2000"
- "they look very, very similar to a pair of like Balenciaga shoes"
- "the closest comparison would be the Nike Rejuvenate"
- External brand comparisons build credibility by showing market awareness.

## Natural Speech Markers

- Heavy "honestly" usage (10+ times — too much, becomes a verbal tic)
- "you know" as filler (frequent)
- "I guess" for soft uncertainty
- "like" for comparisons
- "I mean" before emphasis
- "kind of" as qualifier
- Contractions throughout: "it's", "they're", "you're", "don't", "won't"

## Transition Phrases

Mostly formulaic (weakness):

- "Coming in at number [X]" (repeated)
- "Right, coming in at number three"
- "But coming in at number [X]"
- "But moving on to something new"

Better moments:

- "Now, Adidas has released a couple different versions" (product expansion as transition)
- "Right, before we get into the top three" (structure callout)

## Sentence Rhythm

Mix of long descriptive sentences and short punchy opinions:

- Long: "This version, you have a much more robust textile upper that even has some metal on it over the ice days." (~20 words)
- Short: "Those are bangers." (3 words)
- Short: "Super cozy." (2 words)
- Short: "No idea why." (3 words)

Good variation but some sections run long without a short punch.

## Patterns to ADOPT

1. **External brand comparisons**: Anchoring to Nike, Balenciaga, New Balance builds market authority
2. **Short slang punches**: "Those are bangers." / "They look sick." — authentic and memorable
3. **Grouping similar products**: "I'm going to cheat a little bit" — smart for avoiding repetition
4. **Honorable mentions quickfire**: Builds anticipation before top 3
5. **Winner gets a flaw too**: Even #1 (Evo SL) gets "gusseted tongue which is a little bit annoying"
6. **Version expansion**: Listing multiple versions of #1 shows deep knowledge

## Patterns to AVOID

1. **"Coming in at number [X]"** as primary intro — monotonous after 3+ uses
2. **"Honestly" overuse** — becomes a verbal tic, dilutes authenticity
3. **"Highly recommend" as closer** — used 4+ times, becomes formulaic
4. **Inconsistent limitations** — some products get zero criticism
5. **"you know" filler** — fine in moderation, overused here

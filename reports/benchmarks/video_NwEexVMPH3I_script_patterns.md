# Script Patterns: NwEexVMPH3I — Top 5 Drones

**Channel:** Unknown (generic listicle channel)
**Duration:** ~8 min | **Format:** Top 5 ranked | **Views:** High

## VERDICT: NEGATIVE BENCHMARK (what NOT to do)

This video exemplifies the robotic, AI-adjacent script style we want to avoid.
Use it as a reference for patterns to NEVER replicate.

## Hook (verbatim)

> "Are you looking for the best drone? In this video, we will look at some of the best drone on the market. Before we get started with our video, we have included links in the description."

**Problems:**

- Generic question opening ("Are you looking for...")
- "In this video, we will look at" — filler, zero personality
- "Before we get started" — delays value delivery
- No confusion/overwhelm technique, no specificity

## Transition Phrases

- "Number one," / "Number two," / "Number three," — bare numbering, no award titles
- No transitions between products — just cuts to next number

**Problem:** Zero narrative glue. Feels like reading a list, not watching a video.

## Opinion Markers

- NONE. Zero personal opinion in entire script.
- No "I think", "honestly", "in my experience", "my pick would be"
- Pure spec recitation

## Trust Phrases (Limitations)

- "But it lacks the obstacle avoidance sensors of more expensive models" — decent
- "However, we still prefer DJI drones for their value and image quality" — comparative
- Present but buried in spec paragraphs

## Sentence Length Variation

- Almost all sentences are 15-25 words (monotone)
- No short punchy sentences (< 6 words)
- No rhythm variation

## Product Intro Variety

- Every product opens with model name + generic claim:
  - "If you want the best cameras in a drone, get this model"
  - "This drone offers DJI's autonomous features"
  - "Like other first-person view FPV models, this drone trades..."
- Pattern: [Model name] + [generic descriptor]
- No award titles, no personality

## Banned Patterns Observed (from our blacklist)

- "Are you looking for the best..." — generic question hook
- "In this video, we will look at" — filler
- "Before we get started" — delay
- Identical sentence cadence throughout
- Press-release language: "Unleash your creativity", "Set the social media stage on fire"
- Product #5 (Holy Stone) reads like copied Amazon listing text

## Top 5 ANTI-PATTERNS (what to avoid)

1. Generic question hook with no specificity
2. Zero personal opinion = zero trust
3. Amazon listing language copy-pasted (Holy Stone section)
4. Monotone sentence length = sleep-inducing
5. No transitions = feels like a slideshow, not a narrative

Buying a TV in 2026 is more confusing
than ever? OLED, miniLEDD, QD OLED,
gaming features, AI processing. So,
which one is actually worth your money?
In this video, we cover best TVs of
2026. All the links are in the
description below. Let's get started.
High Sense 65 QF earns the crown of best
budget TV because it delivers real
miniLEDD QLED performance, sharp
brightness, 4K 144 hertz gaming support,
and a big screen experience without
draining your wallet. Right when you
power it up, you'll feel that this isn't
your average bargain bin TV. The U65 QF
uses a miniLEDD QLID panel with full HDR
support. Dolby Vision, HDR10, HDR10
Plus, and HLG, so movies, shows, and
games pop with vibrant colors and deep
contrast. Gamers and action lovers,
listen up. This thing supports 4K at 144
hertz with two HDMI 2.1 ports and VR A
Freync compatibility. Perfect if you're
pairing it with a nextG console or
gaming PC. Fast-paced games, sports, or
any on-screen action runs smooth and
responsive. On top of that, the smart
features are decent. It runs on Fire TV
OS, so you get quick access to Netflix,
Prime Video, and all major streaming
services. But yes, it's not perfect.
Because this is a budget but featurerich
TV, there are still trade-offs. Viewing
angles are a bit limited. If you sit
wide off center, picture quality
degrades.
Sony Bravia 8 2 earns the title best for
movies in our 2026 lineup because it's
built to deliver film lover quality that
few TVs can match. From the moment this
QD OLED panel lights up, you notice the
difference. Thanks to Sony's upgraded
panel and processing engine, the Bravia
82 hits peak HDR brightness levels of up
to 1,439
nits in cinema mode with rich contrast
and deep detailed shadows that make dark
scenes truly immersive. Colors feel
natural, but vibrant, not oversaturated,
but alive. That's crucial when you're
watching movies. The XR Cognitive
Processor and XR OLED Contrast Pro work
behind the scenes to upscale content,
preserve detail in every scene, and
manage motion smoothly.
But picture alone isn't everything.
Sound pulls you deeper into the story.
The Bravier A2 uses acoustic surface
audio plus, which means the screen
itself becomes the speaker. Dialogue and
effects feel like they're coming right
from the characters and visuals on
screen. Add in Dolby Atmas and spatial
upscaling for cinematic surround sound,
even with the built-in speakers. Perfect
for movie nights. As powerful as it is,
the Bravia 82 has a few limitations. For
one, because it's OLED and not a super
bright mini LED, its brilliance in very
bright rooms or full sun daytime viewing
is good, but not unbeatable.
TCL QM8K stands out as 2025's top non
OLED choice. It is an OLED, but it
overcomes many of OLED's weaknesses
while delivering performance that rivals
many premium screens. From the moment
you turn it on, QMK shows you it's
serious about image quality. Its new
Chris Glow QD Mini LED panel powered by
TCL's Halo Control backlight system
delivers peak brightness levels that
blow away most standard LED TVs. Thanks
to up to 3 to800 local dimming zones and
a powerful backlight, HDR scenes pop
with vivid contrast, deep blacks, and
spectacular brightness
for everyday viewing. The AIPQ Processor
intelligently optimizes picture,
fine-tuning color, contrast, motion
smoothness, and clarity.
Gamers and fast action fans get a
serious treat here. QM8K runs at a
native 144 hertz and supports 4K at 144
hertz. VRR Freeync Premium Pro ALLM and
a game accelerator mode for 1440p gaming
make sure games stay smooth and
tearfree. Of course, no TV is perfect.
If you sit far off center, colors can
wash out. Also, viewers have noted minor
haloing or blooming around bright
objects against dark backgrounds.
The LG C5 OLED stands out. That's why we
call it our best gaming TV for 2026
because it delivers gaming grade
performance and OLED level picture
quality. First off, the C5 uses a true
4K OLED panel with pixel level dimming,
which means perfect blacks, infinite
contrast, and vibrant accurate colors,
so games look stunning. It also brings
full nextG gaming features. support for
4K at 144 hertz, VRR, auto low latency
mode, AMD Freync Premium, and Nvidia
G-Sync compatibility. So whether you're
playing on a console or high-end PC,
gameplay stays smooth.
Lag matters for competitive games, and
the C5 nails it with its game optimizer
mode active, input lag drops very low.
Tested at around 9 to 10 MUS, which is
excellent. On top of that, the TV
supports Dolby Vision, HDR10, HLG, and
uses LG's A9 AI processor. That means
upscaling, dynamic tone mapping, and
sharp, clean visuals. OLED has
trade-offs. If you game for many hours a
day, especially titles with static HUDs,
there is a theoretical risk of burn-in
over long-term use.
Samsung S95F earns the title best
overall TV of 2026. It's not just great
at one thing. It's the most complete
package you can buy right now. Balancing
cuttingedge picture quality with
realworld versatility. At the heart of
the S95F is Samsung's latest generation
QD OLED panel, which combines the
perfect blacks of OLED with the color
brightness and punch of quantum dots.
Compared to traditional OLEDs, this
panel delivers higher sustained
brightness, richer colors at high
luminance, and exceptional contrast
without crushing shadow detail. Gaming
is another area where the S95F
dominates. It supports 4K at up to 165
Hz with HDMI 2.1 on multiple ports. VRR,
ALM, FreeSync Premium Pro, and ultra low
input lag. Whether you're on a
PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, or a
high-end gaming PC, this TV handles fast
motion effortlessly.
Samsung also pushed brightness further
this year. The S95 is noticeably
brighter than previous QD OLED models,
making it far more usable in bright
living rooms, one of the biggest
weaknesses of older OLED TVs.
Design is another reason this TV wins.
Overall, the S95F is ultra thin,
premium, and minimalist. It looks like a
flagship product even when turned off.
And that wraps up the best TVs of 2026.
There's no single perfect TV for
everyone. The right choice depends on
how you watch, what you play, and how
much you want to spend. I focused on
real performance, long-term value, and
features that actually matter.

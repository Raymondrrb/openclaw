# Rayviews Visual Style

## Defaults
- Background tone: dark cinematic (tech/gaming/audio) or bright minimal (kitchen/office/baby)
- Color temperature: neutral-warm (5500K feel)
- Light intensity: soft key + subtle rim, never flat
- Always soft depth of field on backgrounds
- Never cluttered backgrounds
- Product must occupy at least 60% of frame in hero/detail shots
- No text overlays in generated images (text added in Resolve)

## Per-Category Overrides
- audio/computing/gaming/streaming: dark gradient, subtle neon accents
- kitchen/home/baby: bright, clean, daylight
- fitness/outdoor: dynamic, natural light
- travel: warm ambient
- office: minimal white + wood
- camera: studio neutral

## Consistency Rules
- Same lighting style within a single video's asset set
- Thumbnail uses stronger contrast than product variants
- Usage scenes maintain the category's color palette
- Detail shots always use directional side lighting
- Mood shots always use volumetric/atmospheric lighting

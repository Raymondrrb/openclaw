# Rayviews Channel Style Guide

## Voice & Tone
- Calm, confident, practical, anti-hype — advisor energy
- You're the trusted friend who did the research and gives it straight
- Confident, not salesy. State facts, acknowledge trade-offs
- Mix short punchy lines with natural explanations
- Never "influencer voice" — let the data speak

## Signature Elements
- One "signature moment" per video (a recurring segment viewers recognize)
- Quick direct product comparisons where relevant
- Honest downsides build trust — never skip them

## Forbidden Phrases
- "game-changer", "revolutionary", "hands down", "blow your mind"
- "In today's video", "Without further ado", "Let's dive in"
- "I was blown away", "This changed my life"

## Pacing Rules
- Pattern interrupt every 60-90 seconds
- Visual change every 3-6 seconds
- Hook must grab in first 10 seconds — never open with channel intro
- Avatar: 20-40 seconds max (intro + mid-video clarity moments)
- Rest of video: B-roll, product shots, comparison graphics

## CTA & Affiliate Disclosure
- CTA: "Links are in the description" (natural, not pushy)
- Disclosure (mandatory, word-for-word or equivalent):
  "Links in the description may be affiliate links, which means I may
  earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. This helps support
  the channel."
- Must contain: affiliate, commission, no extra cost

  "relevance": "Comprehensive Dzine platform walkthrough covering Img2Img workflow details, Lip Sync Pro with multi-speaker support and timeline editor, the new Instant Storyboard tool for combining multiple images into cohesive scenes, and results panel shortcut workflow. Directly applicable to Ray avatar Lip Sync pipeline, product scene composition, and chained generation workflows.",
  "summary": "Blog With Ben provides a 20-minute walkthrough of Dzine's full platform. Covers Img2Img workflow (upload base image, select style, adjust sliders for Style Intensity/Structure Match/Face Match/Color Match, generate 4 variations). Deep-dives into Lip Sync (Normal/Pro modes, 720p/1080p output, 36 credits for Pro 720p, up to 4 simultaneous faces, multi-speaker timeline editor with subjects A/B/C/D, TTS voices with speed slider, multi-language support, aspect ratio cropping). Introduces the new Instant Storyboard tool (V1/V2, combine up to 3 images into one scene using @mentions, shot angle presets, 15 credits). Documents the results panel shortcut buttons (1-4 per variation for Chat Editor, AI Editor, AI Video, Lip Sync, Expression Edit, Face Swap, Enhance & Upscale) and updated sidebar tool order including new Instant Storyboard and Product Background entries.",

      "insight": "Lip Sync Pro mode provides significantly better movement and clarity than Normal",
      "details": "Lip Sync has two generation modes: Normal (basic quality) and Pro (better movement and clarity). Output quality: 720p or 1080p. Cost is 36 credits for Pro at 720p. Pro mode is strongly recommended for production content. Up to 4 faces can be simultaneously detected and animated in a single image.",

      "insight": "Lip Sync supports multi-speaker with timeline editor for speaker sequencing",
      "details": "Multi-speaker mode supports subjects A, B, C, D — each with separate voice assignment and dialogue text. A timeline editor allows dragging audio tracks to order the speaker sequence. This enables conversation-style scenes. Combined with ElevenLabs audio upload (not TTS), this creates professional talking-head segments.",

      "category": "dzine",
      "insight": "Lip Sync TTS has built-in voices, speed slider, and multi-language support",
      "details": "Built-in TTS voices include presets: Britney, James, narrators, social media, conversational styles. 400 character limit per TTS input. Speed slider available. Multi-language support via dropdown with many languages. However, for Rayviews pipeline, upload ElevenLabs audio (Thomas Louis voice) instead of using built-in TTS for voice consistency.",

      "insight": "Lip Sync supports aspect ratio cropping before generation",
      "details": "Before generating Lip Sync video, aspect ratio can be set to: Original, 1:1, 3:4, 4:5, 9:16, 16:9. This allows generating vertical (9:16) or horizontal (16:9) talking-head clips from the same source image without separate cropping. Generation time: 5-10 minutes per clip.",

Output quality: 720p/1080p. Aspect ratio: 9:16, 1:1, 16:9 + more. Advanced settings section. 15 credits per generation. Results show unified lighting, matched shadows, and coherent environment.",

      "details": "Each generated image shows numbered buttons (1-4, one per variation). Clicking a button reveals shortcut actions: Chat Editor, AI Editor, AI Video, Lip Sync, Expression Edit, Face Swap, Enhance & Upscale. This enables rapid chaining: generate image → apply Lip Sync → add Expression Edit, all from the results panel without switching sidebar tools.",

      "details": "Img2Img workflow: upload base image → select style (e.g., Dzine Realistic V3) → type description → adjust sliders. Style Intensity controls how much the chosen style affects output. Structure Match preserves original image composition. Face Match maintains facial features. Color Match preserves original color palette. All four sliders crucial for product image variations that stay faithful to Amazon originals.",

      "details": "The Face Match slider in Img2Img specifically controls how closely the generated face matches the input face. For Ray avatar variations (different poses, clothing, environments), keep Face Match high to maintain recognizable face across all generated images. Structure Match separately controls body/composition preservation.",

      "details": "Lip Sync can be accessed two ways: (1) sidebar tool in the left panel, (2) shortcut buttons on each generated variation in the results panel. The results panel shortcut is faster for chaining — generate an image then immediately apply Lip Sync to a specific variation. Same pattern applies to Expression Edit, Face Swap, etc.",

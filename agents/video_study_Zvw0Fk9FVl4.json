  "relevance": "Official Dzine channel comparison of 6 AI image models using identical prompts across 6 categories. Confirms Nano Banana Pro as best for text-heavy infographics, validates model routing decisions in dzine_schema.py, and documents Expression Edit sliders, Enhance & Upscale capabilities, and current pricing tiers.",
  "summary": "Dzine's official channel tests MidJourney V7, GPT Image 1.5, Flux 2 Pro, Nano Banana Pro, Dzine Realistic V3, and Seedream 4.5 with identical prompts across 6 categories: portraits, infographics, landscapes, character sheets, image-to-image (character sheet to movie poster), and image editing (color/brightness changes). Nano Banana Pro dominates infographics with perfect text rendering. MidJourney V7 wins portraits (emotion/depth) and image editing (precise object changes). Dzine Realistic V3 excels at landscapes. Seedream 4.5 handles character sheets best. Flux 2 Pro wins Img2Img with legible poster text. Also demonstrates Expression Edit (10+ sliders for eyes/mouth/head), Enhance & Upscale (up to 4x, max 6144x3392), AI Expand, AI Eraser, Hand Repair, Background Remove, layers panel, Chat Editor, and Text tool. Pricing ranges from Free (32 credits/day) to Master ($59.99/mo unlimited images).",

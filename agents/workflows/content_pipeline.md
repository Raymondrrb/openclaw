# Workflow: Content Pipeline (Long + Shorts)

Goal: Produce one long video (8–12 min) plus 2–3 Shorts from the same research pack.

Steps:

1. Select one category of the day.
2. Build a strict Top 5 from the same category (no sibling subcategory mixing).
3. Capture current price + rating + rating_count + Amazon availability + pros/cons evidence for all 5 products.
4. Validate each product with Amazon US + trusted external reviews.
5. Generate/verify Amazon affiliate links for every ranked product via SiteStripe `Get link`.
6. Write long script (8-12 min, human-authentic, no AI-generic phrasing).
7. Generate voiceover in segments (max 60-90 seconds each).
8. In Dzine, generate at least 3 original images per product (img2img + NanoBanana Pro), each with visible price overlay.
9. Build final edit timeline map (narration-led visuals with short avatar inserts).
10. Export long video (16:9) and Shorts (9:16).
11. Run QA checklist (factual integrity + humanity check + disclosures) and publish package.

# Workflow: Market Scout Daily

Goal: produce one actionable daily market report with product opportunities for Amazon US review videos.

## Category Of The Day (Mandatory)

- The long video must focus on **one single category per day**.
- Use the category-of-the-day file generated by:
  - `/Users/ray/Documents/Rayviews/tools/pick_daily_category.py --date TODAY`
- Read:
  - `/Users/ray/Documents/Rayviews/reports/market/TODAY_category_of_day.json`
- **Do not override** the category unless the category is impossible to execute today (no viable >$100 products available).
  - If you override, write `reports/market/TODAY_category_override.md` with the reason + the replacement category.

## Cadence

- Run once every day (morning, America/Sao_Paulo).
- Optional second run in the evening for deltas.

## Step 0: Market Intelligence Scan (run first)

Follow `agents/workflows/market_intelligence_playbook.md`:

1. Google Trends US — check breakout queries with buying intent for today's category.
2. Reddit scan — search 2-3 relevant subreddits for buyer discussions (use reddit-readonly skill).
3. TikTok viral scan — check if any products in today's category are going viral (use yt-dlp metadata).
4. Cross-source score — products appearing in 2+ sources get priority.
5. Save as `reports/market/YYYY-MM-DD_market_intelligence.md`.

## Input Sources (minimum set)

1. Market intelligence brief (from Step 0 above).
2. Amazon US:

- Best Sellers pages for target categories.
- Movers & Shakers pages for rising products.
- New Releases pages for launch detection.

3. Trend signals:

- YouTube trend reports in `reports/trends/*.json`.
- Brave Search web+news signals in `reports/trends/*_brave_web.json` and `*_brave_news.json`.
  - Run `python3 tools/brave_trends_batch.py` after YouTube trends to collect web-wide signals.
  - Adds blogs, reviews, Reddit, news articles as a second demand signal layer.
- TikTok/Reels pattern scan (from Step 0).

4. Quality checks:

- Official brand page for model confirmation.
- At least one trusted review source for risk flags.

## Scoring Model (multi-source)

- Amazon BSR movement: 0–5 (rank improving?)
- Google Trends velocity: 0–5 (breakout/rising search interest?)
- Reddit mention frequency: 0–5 (real buyers discussing it?)
- TikTok virality: 0–5 (going viral in product reviews?)
- YouTube views/hour: 0–5
- Brave web/news mentions: 0–5
- YouTube competition gap: 0–5 (is there a good review missing?)
- Opportunity score = weighted sum (see market_intelligence_playbook.md for weights)
- Cross-source bonus: +1 when a product appears in 3+ sources
- 35+ audience bonus: +1 when signals come from older-demographic channels (Reddit, Google, not just TikTok)

## Required Deliverables

1. Markdown report:

- `reports/market/YYYY-MM-DD_market_pulse.md`

2. JSON report:

- `reports/market/YYYY-MM-DD_market_pulse.json`

3. Suggested content queue:

- top 5 ideas for long videos
- top 5 ideas for shorts

4. Gate 1 trigger (quality-first pipeline):

- run `tools/pipeline.py run-e2e --category CATEGORY` to generate the Gate 1 package (products + scripts)
- Pipeline stops automatically at Gate 1 and waits for human approval (no paid steps)

## Report Sections

1. Executive summary (3-5 bullets)
2. Category of the day (single category decision + why)
3. What changed since yesterday
4. Top categories rising now
5. Top products over $100 (ranked)
6. Source quality table (freshness + confidence + cross-check notes)
7. New product watchlist
8. Recommended video opportunities (Top 3 or Top 5)
9. Risks and fact-check items
10. Sources list

## Historical Context (before writing report)

- Run `python3 tools/trend_history_search.py search "<today's category>" --days 15` to check what was reported in recent days for the same category.
- Run `python3 tools/trend_history_search.py timeline "<product name>"` to verify the no-repeat policy (15-day window).
- Use `--source youtube` or `--source brave_web` filters to isolate signal sources.
- Reference historical findings in the "What changed since yesterday" section.

## Guardrails

- Mark anything uncertain as "inference".
- Do not use copied competitor wording.
- If source data conflicts, call it out explicitly.
- Prioritize one category/day for the long video to keep narrative coherence.
- Require multi-source evidence for products selected into the final Top 5.
- Do not auto-publish externally; internal research/script execution is allowed.

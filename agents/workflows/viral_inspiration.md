# Workflow: Viral Inspiration (YouTube Reviews)

Goal: Use daily viral videos to learn structure and hooks, without copying content.

Rules:

1. Never copy phrasing, scripts, or voiceover lines.
2. Only extract structure, pacing, and angle.
3. Every claim in our script must come from sources we can cite.
4. Add at least one original insight per product.

Inputs:

- Daily trends report (YouTube JSON)
- Trend scout notes (TikTok + Reels)
- Category focus (e.g., open-ear earbuds)

Outputs:

- Inspiration brief (structure only)
- Unique angle list (what we add)

# Workflow: Edit Strategist

Goal: maximize retention and monetization quality for Amazon US review videos.

## Inputs

- `content/<slug>/script_long.md`
- `content/<slug>/seo_package.md`
- `content/<slug>/review_final.md`
- Optional: `content/<slug>/video_safe_manifest.md`

## Required output

- `content/<slug>/edit_strategy.md`

## Output structure

1. `Retention map` (0:00 to end, with drop-risk notes)
2. `Scene edit notes` (what visual should happen every 2-4s)
3. `Audio plan` (voice level, music bed, ducking)
4. `Caption style` (mobile-first readability)
5. `CTA strategy` (soft CTA + hard CTA placement)
6. `Monetization checklist` (10 items)
7. `Compliance check` (affiliate + AI disclosure)

## Hard quality gates

- Must avoid long static screens (>4 seconds) without motion.
- Must include at least one trust signal per ranked product.
- Must place affiliate + AI disclosure in spoken or on-screen flow and in description.
- Must add "at time of recording" when citing dynamic metrics.

## Tool note

If assets are vertical/narrow, require `assets/video_safe/` replacements before final export.

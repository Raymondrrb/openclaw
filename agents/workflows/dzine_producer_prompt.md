Use OpenClaw managed browser session with logged-in Dzine account. In Dzine Character tab, always select Character 'Ray'. In Insert Character, always fill both prompts: top = stable Ray identity + outfit for today's products; bottom = character action & product-relevant scene with natural product placement. Execute Lip Sync flow with pro quality and 1080p target when available.

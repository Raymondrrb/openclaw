## Customer Signals

- Positive: 5.0 out of 5 stars Outstanding Headphones, Switched to XM6. The Sony XM5s are fantastic—excellent noise cancellation, crystal-clear sound, and very comfortable for long listening sessions. I loved them so much that I recently upgraded to the XM6s, and the improvements were noticeable, but the XM5s are still an amazing pair on their own. Great build quality and reliable performance make them worth every penny. Read mo
- Positive: 5.0 out of 5 stars Are you Older? READ THIS.. I am almost 65 years old SO, I DO NOT have the ears of a 18 year old. That said, I consider these to be good for these reasons:A: Exceptional battery life.B: Call quality that was considered good UNTIL I did a direct comparison to my Blueparrott B450-XT’s - NO WHERE NEAR the quality of the Blue 450’s, BUT the Blues are made specifically for calls in noisey environments. .
- Positive: 5.0 out of 5 stars Sony never disappoints!. I thoroughly enjoy what Sony has to offer in their product line. I have the PlayStation 5, a Sony Bravia 4K TV and several other Sony products. Yes although I have owned a few of their product line I will not try to be biased here with the review. What got me into Sony products was really their earphones dating back to 2011! They have the best earphones you could get for $2

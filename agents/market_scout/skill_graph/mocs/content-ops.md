# Content Ops MOC

Use this map when the task is to produce or review script artifacts.

- [[script-humanization]] keeps narration natural and avoids repetitive AI phrasing.
- [[evidence-claims]] enforces proof-heavy claims and explicit trade-offs.
- [[gate1-review]] defines what must be visible before approval.
- [[cost-tiering]] scopes quality and compute behavior when budget pressure exists.

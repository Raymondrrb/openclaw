# Script Humanization

The narration should sound like a focused reviewer, not a template generator.

## Core Rules

- Vary opener patterns across products.
- Limit repeated sentence frames and repeated superlatives.
- Always include one specific usage context per product.
- Include at least one caution or limitation in plain language.

When pressure is high, follow [[cost-tiering]] to reduce optional expansion without dropping quality-critical structure.

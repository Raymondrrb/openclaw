# RayViewsLab Skill Graph

This index is the entry point for task-scoped navigation. Start from this file, scan descriptions, then follow only the links that match the active run goal.

## Core MOCs

- [[content-ops]] for script structure, anti-AI quality controls, and Gate 1 package rules.
- [[safety-compliance]] for injection defense, affiliate disclosure, and hard policy checks.
- [[growth-research]] for category selection, ranking logic, and evidence sourcing.

## Cross-Cutting Nodes

- [[distributed-execution]] for Mac controller + Windows worker dispatch.
- [[observability-receipts]] for receipts, logs, idempotency evidence, and audits.

## Usage Rule

Do not load the whole graph. Resolve a short path: index -> one MOC -> 2 to 4 nodes -> execute.

  "relevance": "Highest-performing video studied (1.4M views). Comparison format + curiosity-gap title proves this structure works at massive scale. Professional studio setup is a trust benchmark. BTODtv sells both product categories, so the presenter has genuine expertise. Editing patterns (multi-angle, close-up details, product page intercuts) are directly replicable with Dzine + DaVinci Resolve.",
  "summary": "Compares gaming chairs (Secretlab) vs. office chairs (Herman Miller Embody) from a seller who stocks both. Professional studio with gray walls, framed art, standing desk, plants. Multiple camera angles (wide, medium, close-up detail). Shows btod.com product pages as trust signal. Close-up shots of chair mechanisms (Embody blue spine, armrest joints, tilt). Extremely concise at 6 minutes. 1.4M views proves comparison format + curiosity title works at scale.",

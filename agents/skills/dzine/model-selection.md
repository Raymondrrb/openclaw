## Model-Specific Notes

- **Seedream 4.5**: Superior material textures (metal, fabric, wood). Use when NB Pro texture is flat.
- **Seedream 5.0**: Intelligence/reasoning over aesthetics. Flatter textures than 4.5. Avoid for products.
- **Realistic Product**: Good for studio-lit product shots via Img2Img. Used in current variant routing.
- **FLUX.2 Pro**: Ultra-high-res + excellent text. Alternative for text-heavy thumbnails.

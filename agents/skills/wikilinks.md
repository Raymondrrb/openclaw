# Wikilinks

Wikilinks are not just references. They carry intent.

## Rules

1. Prefer links that encode purpose in sentence context.
2. Use one link per concrete concept, not link spam.
3. Link to MOCs (`*_index`) when broad exploration is needed.
4. Link to specific nodes for actionable execution details.
5. Keep anchors stable; rename nodes only when necessary.

## Good Example

Use [[dzine/product-background]] for scene variation, then validate with [[pipeline/asset-quality-gate]] before approval.

## Anti-Pattern

Writing dense paragraphs with many unrelated links that force blind traversal.

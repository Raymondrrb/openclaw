# Usage Variation Prompt

Second lifestyle shot in a DIFFERENT context than [[lifestyle-shot]]. Must be clearly distinct.

## Template (Product Background) — Kitchen

For floor products (robot vacuums):

```
Bright contemporary kitchen with white subway tile backsplash and
marble countertops visible in soft-focus background. Polished medium-brown
hardwood floor with warm tones. Morning sunlight from side window creating
soft diffused illumination and gentle shadows. Clean modern aesthetic
with stainless steel appliances blurred in background.
45-degree diagonal angle showing product in kitchen context.
```

## Template (Product Background) — Bedroom

For floor products (alternative):

```
Cozy bedroom with light wooden floor, soft natural morning light from
curtained window. Bed with white linen visible in blurred background,
nightstand with small lamp. Warm soft tones, peaceful calm atmosphere.
Eye-level perspective from low angle near floor. Shallow depth of field
with bedroom furniture creating gentle bokeh.
```

## Template (Img2Img) — Kitchen Action

```
Lifestyle product shot of {product_name} on polished hardwood floor
in a bright modern kitchen. White subway tile backsplash, marble countertops
in soft-focus background. Morning light from side window, bright and airy.
45-degree diagonal angle showing product in kitchen context.
Clean contemporary aesthetic. Product unmodified, accurate design.
```

## Key Visual Elements

- **Surface**: Same hardwood but different tone/color than [[lifestyle-shot]]
- **Lighting**: Morning light (vs afternoon in lifestyle)
- **Background**: Kitchen OR bedroom (vs living room in lifestyle)
- **Camera**: 45-degree diagonal (vs 15-degree low angle in lifestyle)
- **Mood**: Bright and clean (kitchen) OR calm and peaceful (bedroom)

## What Makes It Distinct

Must differ from [[lifestyle-shot]] in at least 3 ways:

1. Different room (kitchen/bedroom vs living room)
2. Different lighting time (morning vs afternoon)
3. Different camera angle (45-degree vs 15-degree low)

# Prompt Structure Framework

Every effective product photography prompt follows this modular structure. Each component adds one dimension of visual specificity.

## The 7 Components

```
[1. SHOT TYPE] of [2. PRODUCT + MATERIALS] on [3. SURFACE/PLACEMENT].
[4. ENVIRONMENT DESCRIPTION]. [5. LIGHTING SETUP].
[6. CAMERA SPECIFICATIONS]. [7. MOOD/ATMOSPHERE].
```

### 1. Shot Type (5-10 words)

- "Professional product photography"
- "Lifestyle product photo"
- "Extreme macro close-up"
- "Cinematic editorial shot"

### 2. Product + Materials (10-15 words)

Include specific materials and key visual features:

- "robot vacuum cleaner with glossy black top and brushed aluminum LiDAR turret"
- NOT just "robot vacuum"

### 3. Surface/Placement (5-10 words)

Physical surface the product sits on:

- "on polished warm oak hardwood floor"
- "on seamless matte black studio surface"
- "on polished concrete floor with visible texture"

### 4. Environment (15-25 words)

What's around the product:

- "Modern Scandinavian living room with beige sofa and indoor plants in background"
- "Dark premium studio with gradient background"
- "Industrial space with exposed brick and dark teal walls"

### 5. Lighting (15-20 words)

THE most important differentiator between variants:

- "Three-point lighting: key from 45-degree upper left, fill from right, rim from behind"
- "Natural afternoon sunlight from floor-to-ceiling windows, warm golden tones"
- "Single spotlight from upper left, deep shadows, no fill light"

### 6. Camera (10-15 words)

Lens, angle, focus:

- "85mm lens, eye-level, shallow depth of field, product razor-sharp"
- "35mm wide-angle, 30-degree Dutch angle, dynamic composition"
- "105mm macro, top-down 90 degrees, razor-sharp on texture"

### 7. Mood (5-10 words)

Emotional tone:

- "Premium, aspirational, high-end commercial"
- "Cozy, inviting, warm lifestyle"
- "Dramatic, cinematic, film noir"

## Rules

1. **4-6 high-signal details** — don't overload with 20 adjectives
2. **Lighting is king** — it creates the most visual difference
3. **Surface grounds the product** — it can't float in nothing
4. **Camera angle defines perspective** — low angle vs top-down vs eye-level
5. **Include "product unmodified"** for Img2Img to reduce hallucination
6. **Never use vague words** — "nice", "good", "beautiful" are noise

# Lifestyle Shot Prompt

Shows the product in a real-world context — how it looks in someone's home. Relatable, aspirational but accessible.

## Template (Product Background)

For [[../dzine/product-background]]:

```
Modern living room with warm oak hardwood flooring. Beige fabric sofa
in soft-focus background, indoor potted plants in terracotta pots.
Natural afternoon sunlight streaming through large floor-to-ceiling windows
from the left, creating warm golden tones and soft natural shadows.
Scandinavian minimalist interior, clean and inviting atmosphere.
Low-angle perspective at 15 degrees above floor level.
Shallow depth of field with softly blurred background.
```

## Template (Img2Img)

For [[../dzine/img2img-workflow]]:

```
Lifestyle product photo of {product_name} on warm oak hardwood floor
in a modern living room. Beige fabric sofa in background, indoor plants
in terracotta pots, white walls. Natural afternoon sunlight from large windows,
warm golden tones, soft shadows on floor. Low-angle 15-degree perspective
showing product in real home context. Shallow depth of field, background bokeh.
Cozy, inviting atmosphere. Product unmodified, accurate design preserved.
```

## Key Visual Elements

- **Surface**: Warm hardwood floor (NOT studio surface)
- **Lighting**: Natural window light, afternoon golden tones
- **Background**: Real furniture, plants, home items in soft focus
- **Camera**: Low angle (15 degrees above floor) to show product in context
- **Mood**: Warm, inviting, relatable

## Category-Specific Variants

For robot vacuums / floor products:

- Show on hardwood or tile floor (their natural habitat)
- Include furniture legs in background (they navigate around furniture)
- Low angle emphasizes the floor-level perspective

For desk products (headphones, keyboards):

- Use L01 (Desk Setup) from prompt library
- Modern workspace, monitor glow, clean desk

For kitchen products:

- Use L02 (Kitchen Counter) — marble counter, bright daylight

## What Makes It Distinct

- vs [[hero-shot]]: Real home vs studio. Natural light vs dramatic studio light.
- vs [[detail-shot]]: Full product in environment vs isolated close-up
- vs [[mood-shot]]: Bright and warm vs dark and dramatic
- vs [[usage-variation]]: Different room (living room vs kitchen/bedroom)

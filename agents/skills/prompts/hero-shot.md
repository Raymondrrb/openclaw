# Hero Shot Prompt

The hero shot is the flagship image. Premium, aspirational, high-end commercial photography.

## Template (Product Background)

For [[../dzine/product-background]], describe ONLY the background/scene:

```
Premium dark matte surface with subtle reflections. Professional studio environment
with three-point lighting: soft key light from 45-degree upper left, subtle fill
from right, rim light highlighting product edges. Dark gradient background
transitioning from charcoal to deep navy. Clean minimalist composition with
dramatic cast shadow underneath. High-end e-commerce aesthetic.
```

## Template (Img2Img)

For [[../dzine/img2img-workflow]], describe the FULL scene including product:

```
Professional product photography of {product_name} on a seamless matte black surface.
Dark premium studio environment with three-point lighting setup.
Soft key light from 45-degree angle creating subtle reflections on glossy surfaces.
Rim lighting highlighting circular edges and material transitions.
Dark gradient background from charcoal to deep navy.
85mm lens at eye-level angle. Sharp focus, shallow depth of field.
High-end commercial photography. Product unmodified, accurate proportions.
```

## Key Visual Elements

- **Surface**: Dark matte (NOT white, NOT neutral gray)
- **Lighting**: Three-point — key (upper left), fill (right), rim (behind)
- **Background**: Gradient dark, NOT flat black
- **Shadow**: Dramatic cast shadow for grounding
- **Mood**: Premium, aspirational, luxury

## What Makes It Distinct

Compared to other variants:

- vs [[lifestyle-shot]]: No home environment, pure studio isolation
- vs [[detail-shot]]: Full product visible, not macro close-up
- vs [[mood-shot]]: Clean and polished, not atmospheric/hazy

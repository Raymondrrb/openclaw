# Mood / Editorial Shot Prompt

Cinematic editorial photography. The product tells a visual story. Dramatic lighting, atmosphere, emotion over clarity.

## Template (Product Background)

For [[../dzine/product-background]]:

```
Dramatic industrial environment with polished concrete floor showing
visible texture. Exposed brick wall with dark teal color grading in background.
Single spotlight from upper left creating strong directional light and
deep shadows. Atmospheric haze or light fog adding depth layers.
Volumetric light rays visible in the air. Low-key cinematic lighting
with warm amber key light and cool blue fill. Film noir aesthetic.
```

## Template (Img2Img)

For [[../dzine/img2img-workflow]]:

```
Cinematic editorial product shot of {product_name} on polished concrete
floor with visible texture. Dramatic moody atmosphere with single spotlight
from upper left, strong directional light creating deep shadows.
Atmospheric haze and volumetric light rays. Industrial exposed brick wall
with dark teal color grading in background. 35mm wide-angle lens,
30-degree Dutch angle for dynamic composition. Film noir aesthetic,
desaturated palette except warm highlights. Product unmodified.
```

## Key Visual Elements

- **Surface**: Textured (concrete, stone, industrial) — NOT clean/smooth
- **Lighting**: Single directional source, deep shadows, NO fill light
- **Atmosphere**: Haze, fog, volumetric light rays
- **Background**: Industrial, architectural, textured walls
- **Camera**: Wide angle (35mm), Dutch angle for dynamism
- **Color**: Desaturated with selective warm/cool accents
- **Mood**: Dramatic, mysterious, cinematic, emotional

## What Makes It Distinct

This is the MOST different variant from all others:

- vs [[hero-shot]]: Textured environment vs clean studio. One light vs three-point.
- vs [[lifestyle-shot]]: Industrial vs home. Cool/moody vs warm/inviting.
- vs [[detail-shot]]: Full scene storytelling vs isolated macro detail.
- Only variant that uses atmospheric haze and Dutch angle.

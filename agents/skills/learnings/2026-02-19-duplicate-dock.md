# 2026-02-19 — Duplicate Dock Artifact

## Incident

Generated image added a second charging dock that did not exist in the intended scene.

## Root Cause

Reference image had visual clutter and ambiguous shapes near the dock area. Generation model interpreted the pattern as an extra dock.

## Fix Applied

1. Switched to a cleaner alternate Amazon reference.
2. Cropped reference tighter around product + real dock.
3. Re-generated with explicit prompt constraint: one dock only.

## Prevention Rule

Before generation, reject references with ambiguous duplicate-like structures in the foreground/background.

# Dzine Visual System — Amazon Associates Product Ranking Channel

## Context

Rayviews produces YouTube product ranking videos (Top 5 format) monetized via Amazon Associates. Dzine generates variant images per product for visual variety during 8-12 minute videos.

Default: 1 thumbnail + 3 images per product (hero, usage, detail) = 16 images per video.
With hierarchy upgrade: rank #2 adds mood (+1), rank #1 adds usage2 + mood (+2) = up to 19 images.

## Product Preservation Rules (STRICT)

1. Use the uploaded Amazon product image as strict visual reference.
2. Preserve exact geometry, shape, buttons, ports, branding, and color.
3. Do NOT modify the product design in any way.
4. Do NOT add features, accessories, or elements not present on the real product.
5. Do NOT change product colors or materials.
6. Do NOT distort or stylize the brand logo.
7. Do NOT add text, badges, or labels to the product.

## Reference Image Workflow

1. Download product image from `image_url` in products.json
2. Save to `assets/amazon/{rank:02d}_ref.jpg`
3. Upload as reference when generating Dzine images
4. Dzine preserves product design while changing scene/lighting
5. Skip gracefully if download fails (generate without reference)

---

## Amazon Associates Compliance

Never generate images that imply:
- Official Amazon partnership or endorsement
- Fake discount badges or price tags
- Urgency banners ("Limited time!", "Only 3 left!")
- Review scores or star ratings in the image

All visuals must support honest product presentation.

## Visual Consistency

Reference `channel/channel_visual_style.md` for:
- Per-category color temperature and background tone
- Lighting consistency within a single video's asset set
- Dark cinematic for tech/gaming/audio, bright minimal for kitchen/office/baby

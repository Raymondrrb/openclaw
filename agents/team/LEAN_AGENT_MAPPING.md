# Lean Agent Mapping

Daily pipeline uses logical roles, but resolves to a smaller core set.

## Logical Role -> Resolved Agent

- researcher -> researcher
- affiliate_linker -> researcher
- scriptwriter -> scriptwriter
- seo -> scriptwriter
- reviewer -> reviewer
- edit_strategist -> reviewer
- quality_gate -> reviewer
- asset_hunter -> dzine_producer
- dzine_producer -> dzine_producer
- davinci_editor -> davinci_editor
- publisher -> publisher
- youtube_uploader -> publisher

## Why

- Fewer handoffs
- Lower context fragmentation
- Clear accountability per stage

## Core Daily Team

- market_scout
- researcher
- scriptwriter
- reviewer
- dzine_producer
- davinci_editor
- publisher

  "relevance": "Comprehensive 5-hour DaVinci Resolve course covering all 7 pages. Provides the foundational knowledge for every editing decision in the Rayviews pipeline: timeline assembly, Fairlight audio mixing with bus routing, Color Page node architecture, Fusion compositing for text overlays, and Deliver Page export settings including the H.265 + 4K upres trick for YouTube.",
  "summary": "Casey Faris (Blackmagic Certified Trainer, 554K subscribers) delivers a complete DaVinci Resolve 20 course covering Media Page (import, bins, metadata), Edit Page (insert modes, trim operations, Inspector properties, keyframe animation, Dynamic Zoom), Cut Page (dual-timeline rough assembly), Fusion Page (node compositing, Text+, Merge, masks, templates/macros), Color Page (YRGB Color Managed, node types, color wheels, curves, scopes, windows/qualifiers, gallery stills for batch grading), Fairlight Page (bus routing, EQ, Dialogue Compression preset, volume automation, Sound Library), and Deliver Page (H.265 Master + Ultra HD upres for YouTube, ProRes 422 HQ + Linear PCM archive, Render Queue batching). The course provides the conceptual model that maps directly to DaVinci Resolve's Python scripting API for pipeline automation.",

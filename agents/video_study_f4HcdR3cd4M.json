  "relevance": "Demonstrates the EXACT technique needed for Ray avatar consistency across all Rayviews videos. A single character reference sheet (multi-angle views) generated in Nano Banana Pro serves as the master ingredient for every subsequent scene and video generation, ensuring consistent identity through wardrobe changes and different environments. This is the foundational technique for the Ray Avatar Plan.",
  "summary": "AI Video School demonstrates creating character reference sheets in Nano Banana Pro using a single reference photo plus a specialized prompt. The sheet shows the character from multiple angles (full body: front, left side, right side, back; face close-ups: front, 3/4, side) in 16:9 format. This sheet then serves as an 'ingredient' (element/reference) when generating scenes or videos, maintaining character consistency. Critical discovery: ALWAYS include the character sheet as an ingredient even when you already have a start frame for video generation. The technique supports wardrobe changes (same face/body, different clothing) and multi-character scenes (upload multiple character sheets). The workflow uses the 'Add To Prompt' button and the Scenebuilder view within the Flow interface.",

      "details": "The character sheet is generated in 16:9 format containing: top row = full body views (front, left side, right side, back), bottom row = face close-ups (front, 3/4, side). Nano Banana Pro generates this from a single reference photo plus the character sheet prompt. Output is incredibly detailed -- Nano Banana Pro excels at this structured multi-view generation. The 16:9 format is optimal because it provides enough horizontal space for all angle views.",

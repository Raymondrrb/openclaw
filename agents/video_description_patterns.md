## Key Patterns for Rayviews

### 1. Affiliate Link Format (CRITICAL)

**Winner: amzn.to short links** — used by 7/8 channels. This is the Site Stripe format Rayviews already captures.

```
Product Name
Amazon - https://amzn.to/XXXXXXX
```

**BTODtv exception:** Uses own domain redirects (`btodtv.com/XXXXXXX`) — likely Bitly or custom shortener for tracking.

**Multi-store pattern (BR only):** Top Tech lists 3 stores per product (Amazon, MercadoLivre, AliExpress). Rayviews targets US audience, so Amazon-only is correct.

### 2. Description Structure (Recommended Template)

Based on highest-performing videos, optimal structure:

```
[SEO hook paragraph - 1-2 sentences with main keywords]

[Product links - numbered, with amzn.to short links]

[Chapter markers - timestamps with product names]

[Affiliate disclosure - brief, honest]
```

### 3. Chapter Markers

**3/8 videos use them.** The two highest-quality descriptions (Product Guide, Jacob Nordin) both include them. Format:

```
00:00 Intro
00:25 5. Tineco Pure ONE S11
02:00 4. Hoover ONEPWR Evolve
...
```

Product Guide adds rank number emojis. Jacob Nordin uses descriptive text. **Rayviews should always include chapters** — they improve viewer retention and YouTube SEO.

### 4. Product Link Formatting

**Three styles observed:**

**Style A (Product Guide) — BEST for affiliate:**
```
1. Dyson V15 Detect
Check Prices - https://amzn.to/3wFNQWD
```

**Style B (Top Tech) — Multi-store:**
```
Haylou Rs5
Amazon - https://amzn.to/45H1WW2
Mercado Livre - https://mercadolivre.com/sec/1zJuqHU
```

**Style C (TechShare) — Inline:**
```
https://amzn.to/4ktG3iE - Levoit LVAC-200
```

**Recommendation:** Style A (Product Guide). Clear, scannable, CTA-driven ("Check Prices").

### 5. SEO Paragraph Strategy

**Product Guide** has a massive SEO-stuffed paragraph at the bottom (200+ words, repeating "best vacuum cleaner" variants). This is a known YouTube SEO technique — YouTube's algorithm reads description text for topic classification.

**TechShare** puts keyword-rich text at the top (better for viewer engagement).

**Recommendation:** 2-3 keyword-rich sentences at top, NOT a wall of text at bottom (Google has been devaluing keyword stuffing since 2024).

### 6. Affiliate Disclosure

**Three approaches:**

1. **Amazon boilerplate** (Product Guide, TechShare): "We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program..."
2. **Custom honest** (Jacob Nordin): "Some links are affiliate links... at no extra cost to you"
3. **None** (Top Tech, Declan Jenkinson)

**Recommendation:** Short honest disclosure at bottom. Required by FTC for US creators:
```
Affiliate Disclosure: As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases at no extra cost to you.
```

### 7. Additional Monetization Hooks

- **Telegram promo groups** (Top Tech) — community monetization
- **Own product links** (Jamie Fenn, Jacob Nordin) — LUTs, presets
- **Sale promotions** (BTODtv) — time-limited sale at top of description
- **Collection link** (TechShare) — single Amazon link to all products
- **Watch Next** (BTODtv) — internal video cross-promotion

**Recommendation:** Add "Watch Next" links (cross-promotion between Rayviews videos) once we have multiple videos published.

## Implementation in Pipeline

The description template should be auto-generated from:
- `seo.json` — keywords, title
- `products.json` — product names, Amazon links, rank labels
- `tts_audio/` — timestamps for chapter markers (from TTS chunk boundaries)

Add to `tools/lib/script_schema.py` or new `tools/lib/description_generate.py`.

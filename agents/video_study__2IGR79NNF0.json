  "relevance": "Demonstrates end-to-end workflow for creating realistic AI characters with Nano Banana Pro and animating them with multi-speaker lip sync in a podcast-style setup. Directly applicable to Ray avatar talking-head segments and provides a complete AI video model catalog with credit pricing for B-roll generation decisions.",
  "summary": "Wulfranz demonstrates using Dzine's Nano Banana Pro model to generate realistic AI characters, then animating them with lip sync for a podcast-style multi-speaker setup. The workflow covers character creation via Nano Banana Pro (chosen over Flux 2 for better context understanding), Img2Img transformation with visible settings (Style Intensity 0.6, Structure Match 0.6, Face Match ON, HQ mode at 16 credits), multi-character lip sync with up to 4 simultaneous faces, timeline-based dialogue sequencing per speaker, and custom voice import. The video also reveals a complete AI video model catalog visible in the Dzine interface, with pricing from 6 credits (Wan 2.1) to 215 credits (Kling 2.1 Master 1080p).",

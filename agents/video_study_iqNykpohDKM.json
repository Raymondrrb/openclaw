  "relevance": "DaVinci Resolve tutorial — not a competitor format but a direct source of editing techniques for our post-production workflow. Covers Power Bins, Adjustment Clips, Fairlight Presets, Noise Reduction shared nodes, Smart Bins, and multi-track audio organization. All techniques applicable to Rayviews Resolve assembly pipeline.",
  "summary": "18 DaVinci Resolve productivity hacks demonstrated in Resolve 20 Studio. Screen recordings show complex multi-track timeline (3+ video tracks, 6+ audio tracks), Power Bins with organized folders, Adjustment Clips on V2, Fairlight Configuration Presets, shared Noise Reduction nodes in Color page, and Smart Bins. Cinematic B-roll inserts (keyboard close-ups, nature footage) break up screen recordings. 178K views with 7.5% like ratio indicates high audience value.",

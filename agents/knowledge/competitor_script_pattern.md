# Competitor Script Pattern: "Best [X] of 2026" (TechVisions)

Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjtHXc4O1Z8
Channel: TechVisions
Title: "Best TVs of 2026 (Watch this First)"
Duration: 6:24 (384 seconds)
Segments: 169 auto-caption blocks

## Structure Breakdown

### 1. Hook (0:00-0:12) ~40 words

**Pattern:** Problem statement + overwhelm + value proposition + CTA

> "Buying a TV in 2026 is more confusing than ever. OLED, miniLED, QD OLED,
> gaming features, AI processing. So, which one is actually worth your money?
> In this video, we cover best TVs of 2026. All the links are in the description
> below. Let's get started."

**Key elements:**

- Opens with a pain point the viewer already feels
- Lists confusing jargon (establishes authority by naming things viewers are confused about)
- Asks the viewer's exact question back at them
- Quick "links in description" affiliate nudge before content starts
- "Let's get started" transition (short, no wasted words)

**Timing:** Under 15 seconds. No intro animation, no channel bumper.

### 2. Ranked Sections: #5 to #1 (0:14-5:02) ~4.5 min

Each product follows an identical sub-structure (60-80 seconds each):

#### Per-Product Template (~120-150 words)

1. **Title sentence** (Award + product name):
   "Hisense U65QF earns the crown of best budget TV because..."

2. **Why it won** (1-2 sentences connecting the award to key features):
   "...it delivers real miniLED QLED performance, sharp brightness, 4K 144Hz
   gaming support, and a big screen experience without draining your wallet."

3. **Spec deep-dive** (3-4 sentences with real numbers):
   Panel type, HDR formats, ports, refresh rate, smart OS

4. **Who it's for** (1 sentence, specific scenario):
   "Perfect if you're pairing it with a next-gen console or gaming PC."

5. **Honest limitation** (1-2 sentences, always present):
   "Viewing angles are a bit limited. If you sit wide off center, picture quality degrades."

#### Product sections in order:

| #        | Product          | Award            | Duration        |
| -------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Budget   | Hisense U65QF    | Best Budget TV   | 0:14-1:21 (67s) |
| Movies   | Sony Bravia 8 II | Best for Movies  | 1:21-2:42 (81s) |
| Non-OLED | TCL QM8K         | Best Non-OLED TV | 2:42-3:55 (73s) |
| Gaming   | LG C5            | Best Gaming TV   | 3:55-5:02 (67s) |
| Overall  | Samsung S95F     | Best TV of 2026  | 5:02-6:04 (62s) |

**Note:** This video uses 5 products but does NOT number them #5 to #1.
Instead it uses **category awards** (Best Budget, Best for Movies, etc.)
with the overall winner last. This is a variation worth considering.

---

### 3. Wrap-up (6:04-6:24) ~20 seconds

> "And that wraps up the best TVs of 2026. There's no single perfect TV for
> everyone. The right choice depends on how you watch, what you play, and how
> much you want to spend. I focused on real performance, long-term value, and
> features that actually matter."

**Pattern:**

- Acknowledges no universal winner (builds trust)
- Reminds viewer of the ranking criteria
- No explicit CTA to subscribe (relies on value delivery)
- No "buyer mapping" section (shorter format tradeoff)

## Patterns Worth Adopting

### 1. Stronger Hook Formula

Their hook names the exact confusion the viewer feels. Our hooks tend to be more generic.

**Adopt:** Open with the specific decision paralysis in the category.

- Bad: "Looking for the best [X]? We've got you covered."
- Good: "Buying a [X] in 2026 is more confusing than ever. [Jargon A], [Jargon B], [Jargon C]. Which one is actually worth your money?"

### 2. Category Awards Instead of Pure Numbering

Instead of "#5 is... #4 is... #3 is..." they give each product a specific award.
This makes each product feel like a winner, not a loser that didn't make #1.

**Adopt:** Use hybrid: keep numbered ranking but add award titles.

- "#5 — JBL Soundgear Sense (Best Entry Pick)" (we already do this)
- Ensure every product has a clear "Best [X]" subtitle

### 3. Spec-First Authority

They lead with real specifications immediately after the title sentence.
Panel type, HDR formats, port counts, refresh rates. No fluff between.

**Adopt:** Ensure spec deep-dive comes within the first 2-3 sentences of each product section, not buried after opinion.

### 4. Single Honest Limitation (Always)

Every single product ends with a clear limitation. Not a deal-breaker framing, but an honest "but..." moment. This builds enormous credibility.

**Adopt:** We already do this. Keep it. Never skip.

### 5. Tighter Pacing

Their 6:24 video covers 5 products with real depth. Our 8-12 min target allows more space but risks losing retention.

**Consider:** Aim for 8 min (lower bound) more often. Trim criteria section and buyer mapping when the category is straightforward.

## What NOT to Copy

- No AI disclosure (we must include it, FTC requirement)
- No criteria section (we need it for transparency)
- No buyer mapping (valuable for our audience, keeps it)
- No subscribe CTA (we should keep a soft CTA)
- Short format only (our longer format allows more depth and better SEO)
